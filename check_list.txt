Issues I ran into:
1. Some compressed files do not have an extension like .gz, and if I want to preserve the original file, I will need to address it
2. Unpacking files inside a folder one level deep - without unpacking other folders in the parent folder
3. Zip is special because unlike the other compression formats, it can compress a few file into one archive, unlike bzip2 or gzip.
